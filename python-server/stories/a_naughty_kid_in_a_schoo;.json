    "story": "## The Boy Who Could Make Rainbows\n\nIn a bustling village schoolhouse, nestled amidst the green paddy fields, lived a mischievous boy named Chotu.  Chotu, with his mop of unruly hair and a twinkle in his eye, was a whirlwind of energy, always seeking adventure and a good laugh.  His teachers, though exasperated by his antics, couldn't help but smile at his infectious enthusiasm.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, as the children sat in their classroom, Chotu's attention was drawn to a ray of sunlight piercing through a crack in the wall.  He squinted, his mind racing.  He grabbed a chipped piece of glass from his pocket and, with a mischievous grin, held it up to the sunbeam.  A kaleidoscope of colours danced on the wall, illuminating the room with a vibrant rainbow.\n\nThe children gasped in wonder, their eyes wide with awe.  Even the stern teacher, Miss Mukherjee, couldn't help but be momentarily mesmerized by the unexpected spectacle.\n\n\"Chotu, what are you doing?!\" she exclaimed, her voice sharp but tinged with amusement.\n\nChotu, ever the showman, winked at his classmates and replied, \"I am making rainbows, Miss Mukherjee!  I have a magic glass that turns sunlight into colours.\"\n\nThe children erupted in excited chatter, their faces lit up with a mixture of disbelief and wonder.  Chotu, emboldened by their admiration, continued his impromptu performance, swirling the glass, creating ever-shifting patterns of light and shadow.\n\nMiss Mukherjee, though initially annoyed, realized the opportunity to turn this into a learning experience.  She called the class to order and, with a twinkle in her eye, explained the science behind the phenomenon.  Chotu, ever the curious learner, sat attentively, soaking in the information.\n\nFrom that day onwards, Chotu became known as the \"Rainbow Boy.\"  His mischievous nature remained, but he learned to channel his energy into creative pursuits, using his \"magic glass\" to create fascinating displays of light and colour.  He even discovered that he could use his newfound knowledge to create beautiful patterns on the walls of the schoolhouse, bringing a touch of magic to their everyday lives. \n\nAnd so, the naughty boy who could make rainbows became a beloved part of the school, reminding everyone that even the most mischievous of hearts can hold a spark of wonder and creativity. \n",
